# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Connection Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase Realtime Database interactions: attempting to access data before the database connection is established.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that uses promises or async/await to ensure the connection is ready before accessing the database.

This issue often results in silent failures or unpredictable behavior.  The solution ensures data operations only occur after the database is connected, preventing these problems.  Proper asynchronous programming techniques are key to successful Firebase usage.
